The space is designed for freedom of choice—play, socialise, watch sport or simply soak up the vibe. We make it comfortable for guests who come for the thrill and for those who prefer focused, composed play. We value the details, so the feeling of style carries through every moment.\n\n<\/p>\n<br>\n\n\n<p>\nWe’re open daily from 12:00 to 05:00, giving you the flexibility to visit when it suits you. If you’re here for live tables, you’ll feel the distinctive momentum as the afternoon turns into a full evening experience. The late‑night format means you never have to rush your time with us. It’s easy to start with relaxed downtime and shift into gaming when the mood hits.\n\n<\/p>\n<br>\n<p>\nOur Late Bar is where the night shines—cocktails, classic pours and a true big‑night atmosphere. The bar is open daily from 12:00 to 01:00, so you can begin with an aperitif or pause between sessions in style. We build a friendly setting that works for meeting friends, celebrating something special or unwinding after a busy day. Drinks, vibe and service come together to keep the night smooth and memorable.\n\n<\/p>\n<br>\n<p>\nIf you enjoy a fuller experience, we always have more to pair with gaming: major live sport broadcasts, themed nights and fresh reasons to return. We keep a lively, club‑like energy that makes you want to stay longer. Nearby accommodation options are easy to access, making it simple to plan an overnight stay close by. This is the kind of venue that fits both spontaneous visits and carefully planned nights out.\n\n<\/p>\n<br>\n<p>\nWe reward regular guests with a strong set of perks and bonus opportunities. Our loyalty programme adds value through privileges, extra rewards and tailored offers. We also run monthly promotions so every visit feels richer and more exciting. From first impression to the final highlight, the night is crafted to feel complete.\n\n<\/p>\n<br>\n\n\n<h3 style = \"font-weight: bold;font-size: 32px;\">\nService and Payments — Clear, Simple, Comfortable\n<\/h3>\n\n<p>\nOur team delivers confident professionalism with genuine attention to every guest. We help first‑timers settle in, explain rules clearly and make the experience feel relaxed from the start. For experienced players, we keep service quick, accurate and smooth—right through from seating to settling results. Communication stays polite and precise, with a warm tone that keeps the night easy.\n\n<\/p>\n<br>\n\n\n<p>\nEnglish is our main language, and we’re used to welcoming guests from many different backgrounds. If you want clarity around game terms or table rules, we explain everything in a straightforward, respectful way. We focus on clear guidance and fast solutions, so you spend more time enjoying the moment. On the floor, it’s easy to ask about games, stakes and table formats without breaking your rhythm.\n\n<\/p>\n<br>\n<p>\nTransactions are handled in pounds sterling. For guest convenience, we support widely used payment options suited to top‑ups and on‑site spending. Bank cards from major networks are typically accepted, along with cash for eligible operations under venue rules. We keep the process transparent, so you understand what happens before anything is processed.\n\n<\/p>\n<br>\n<p>\nFor quick access to cash, ATMs are available close by within the surrounding area, and currency exchange can be arranged through familiar nearby services when needed. We help you navigate the best way to manage your spend—where to withdraw, how to top up smoothly, and what suits your visit style. If you prefer cashless, we support it with speed and ease. A key principle for us is payment security and careful handling of every transaction.\n\n<\/p>\n<br>\n<p>\nCashing out winnings is designed to feel calm and straightforward. You receive settlement in a clear format, and we guide you towards the most convenient method—cash or other available payment routes. Standard identity checks and security procedures help protect your funds and keep everything accurate. In most cases, player winnings are not taxed, and if anything depends on personal circumstances, it’s best handled in line with individual obligations and official rules.\n\n<\/p>\n<br>\n\n\n\n<h3 style = \"font-weight: bold;font-size: 32px;\">\nVisiting Rules — Simple, Clear, Comfortable\n<\/h3>\n\n<p>\nWe follow a smart casual standard to keep the atmosphere stylish and enjoyable for everyone. Entry is for adult guests, and we may ask for valid photo ID to confirm age. We expect respectful behaviour and a friendly tone across the venue. Aggressive conduct and anything that affects safety or comfort is not permitted. Responsible play and self‑control are part of our culture. We maintain a neat, well‑presented environment so the night feels premium. For security, standard monitoring and access control apply in certain areas. We ask guests to avoid face‑covering items and to keep headwear off on the gaming floor. At tables, seating is reserved for active players. We’re always happy to explain entry procedures and help you move through any registration smoothly. Getting here is easy by car, taxi or public transport. Parking solutions are in place to make your visit convenient.\n\n<\/p>\n<br>\n\n<h4 style = \"font-weight: bold; font-size: 24px;\">\nKey rules \n<\/h4>\n\n <ul>\n            <li>• \nDress code: smart casual, neat appearance, closed footwear; sportswear and football shirts are not encouraged.\n\n<\/li>\n            <li>• \nAge: 18+ only, ID checks may apply.\n\n<\/li>\n            <li>• \nBehaviour: respect guests and staff, keep it calm and friendly.\n\n<\/li>\n            <li>• \nProhibited actions: no illegal activity, no interference with games, no safety breaches.\n\n<\/li>\n\t    <li>• \nPhotos and filming: restrictions may apply in certain areas for guest privacy.\n\n<\/li>\n\t    <li>• \nTable seating: seats are for players; watching is welcome without disrupting play.\n\n<\/li>\n\t    <li>• \nParking: convenient parking options are available nearby.\n\n<\/li>\n\t    <li>• \nGetting here: easy access by car, taxi, and public transport routes.\n\n\n<\/li>\n        <\/ul><br>\n\n<h3 style = \"font-weight: bold;font-size: 32px;\">\nOur Loyalty Programme — More Value Every Time You Visit\n<\/h3>\n\n<p>\nWe reward guests who choose us again and again, turning regular visits into tangible benefits.

It’s easy to begin with play, shift into the bar scene, and continue the night in full entertainment mode without changing venues. Regular evening formats keep a strong nightlife feel: the right lighting, upbeat sound and an atmosphere you want to be part of. We put special focus on recurring entertainment so you know there’s always something to catch, any day you visit.\n\n<\/p>\n<br>\n\n<p>\nOur late‑night vibe builds as the venue comes alive—more buzz, more momentum, and a stronger sense of occasion. We support major live sport broadcasts so you can watch the biggest fixtures in great company with smooth service. On selected dates, we run themed nights that turn your visit into a true event—music‑led energy and that celebratory feel. Everything is designed to complement the gaming experience, not distract from it.\n\n<\/p>\n<br>\n<p>\nFor guests who enjoy competitive excitement, we support skill‑driven formats and special gaming moments that add extra edge to the night. For groups, we create the ideal night‑out rhythm: start with play, move into drinks, and finish on a high with an entertainment highlight. That flow makes the experience feel complete and memorable. You don’t get scattered options—you get a curated night.\n\n<\/p>\n<br>\n\n\n<h4 style = \"font-weight: bold; font-size: 24px;\">\nAll entertainment\n<\/h4>\n\n <ul>\n            <li>• \nLive Sports: major fixtures on screens with a shared viewing buzz.\n\n<\/li>\n            <li>• \nThemed nights: music and mood that make the night feel special.\n\n<\/li>\n            <li>• \nGaming events: competitive formats and special reasons to play.\n\n<\/li>\n            <li>• \nSeasonal weeks: calendar highlights with a bigger celebration feel.\n\n<\/li>\n\t    <li>• \nBar‑led nightlife: cocktail culture and strong late‑night vibe.\n\n\n<\/li>\n        <\/ul><br>\n\n\n<h3 style = \"font-weight: bold;font-size: 32px;\">\nBars, Leisure and Night‑Out Comfort — Built for Your Perfect Visit\n<\/h3>\n\n<p>\nWe design leisure to feel as exciting as the gaming itself. Our Late Bar is a true focal point where cocktails, classic pours and a late‑night atmosphere come together as one smooth vibe. It’s the perfect place to start your evening, take a stylish break between sessions, or finish the night with a final highlight. We keep service friendly and confident, so you can relax comfortably with friends or unwind solo.\n\n<\/p>\n<br>\n<p>\nYour food and drink moments are built for ease, keeping you in rhythm when you want a bite or another drink. The bar atmosphere keeps the sense of occasion alive, even if you only planned a short visit. We focus on a cohesive feel—music, lighting and mood support a premium night‑out style. That way, downtime becomes part of the overall experience, not a separate detour.\n\n<\/p>\n<br>\n<p>\nIf you’re planning a longer stay, nearby hotel options make it easy to extend the night without rushing. The surrounding area offers plenty of convenient accommodation, letting your visit turn into a full overnight experience. We work brilliantly for quick stops and for bigger nights with a complete plan. The result is a night that feels thoughtfully put together from start to finish.\n\n<\/p>\n<br>\n\n\n\n<h4 style = \"font-weight: bold; font-size: 24px;\">\nAll leisure spots\n<\/h4>\n\n <ul>\n            <li>• \nThe Late Bar: cocktails, drinks and a strong late‑night atmosphere.\n\n<\/li>\n            <li>• \nLounge areas: comfortable spots to pause and reset between sessions.\n\n<\/li>\n            <li>• \nNearby hotels: convenient accommodation options close by for extended stays.\n\n\n<\/li>\n\n        <\/ul><br>\n"
